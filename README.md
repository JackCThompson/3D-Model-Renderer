# 3D-Model-Renderer

This program loads point, polygon, and color data from a text file and renders a model in 3D perspective using 2D rendering methods.
Controls:
  Use the mouse to rotate the camera
  W, A, S, and D keys to move forward, left, backward, and right repectively
  Space and shift keys to move up and down respectively
  Escape key to close the program
  
WARNING: The program takes control of the mouse even if you minimize the window. Ending the program with the escape key is the only way to regain control

WARNING: There is a bug with the Java.awt.Robot class so the mouse controls glitch out on high resolution monitors. For now, this program should work on an HD screen but not a 4k screen
